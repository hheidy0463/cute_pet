PyInstaller used to package the Python script into a standalone application that can be run on a computer. 

PyInstaller: This tool takes a Python script and creates an executable file (.exe on Windows, .app on macOS, or a binary on Linux). It also bundles all the dependencies so you can run the program on any machine, even if Python isn't installed.
